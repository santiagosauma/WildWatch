## 🌍 Overview

**WILDWATCH** is an educational video game developed as part of a school project for a course. The game is designed to gamify the process of wildlife monitoring by forest rangers in Colombia, under the guidance of the AWAQ organization. It focuses on training players to conduct various sampling methods used in the field to count and identify different types of wildlife and plants, such as insects, amphibians and reptiles, mammals, birds, and plants.

The game is developed using **Unity** and is specifically designed to be played on **iPads**. It includes a central hub and five main mini-games, each tailored to simulate the specific sampling methods for different categories. Additionally, players will use an in-game notebook to record and identify species as they progress through the mini-games. This notebook is later used to fill in a tablet with details such as the species, quantity, and observations.

**This project is strictly educational and non-commercial, developed with no intent for profit.**

## 🎮 Features

- **🏠 Central Hub (The House)**: The game begins with a tutorial inside a house, which serves as the central hub. Here, players learn how to use the in-game tablet (iPad) to navigate the game and record species. From the house, players can access each of the five mini-games through doors that lead to different environments. Above each door, players can see their score represented by stars, which reflect their performance in the respective mini-game.

- **🕹️ 5 Engaging Mini-Games**: Each mini-game represents a different sampling method:
  - **🐜 Insects**: A memorization game where the player uses a lamp to spot insects moving around. The player must move the lamp to shine light on the insects, and after a certain time, they will need to identify the type of insects observed.
  - **🐸 Amphibians and Reptiles**: The player clicks on rocks and plants to discover hidden amphibians and reptiles. This must be done within a time limit, encouraging quick thinking and fast identification to find all the hidden creatures.
  - **🦝 Mammals**: Set up traps based on animal tracks and learn about track stations for monitoring mammals.
  - **🦜 Birds**: The player uses a binocular-like view to spot birds flying by. By listening to the bird songs and calls, the player must identify the species both visually and audibly. Points are earned by correctly identifying the birds through the binoculars and by matching their songs in a special identification window.
  - **🌱 Plants**: The player explores the map within a time limit, clicking on various plants to identify them. Quick and accurate identification is key to successfully cataloging all the plant species in the area.

- **📒 Notebook and Tablet Integration**: Throughout all the mini-games, the player uses a notebook to log the species they have identified. After completing the mini-games, the player returns to the house and uses this notebook to fill in details on the tablet, including the species, quantity, and other observations. This step reinforces the process of accurate data recording, which is crucial in real-world monitoring efforts.

- **⭐ Scoring System**: The player’s performance in each mini-game is reflected in the house by stars displayed above the doors leading to each mini-game. This visual feedback allows the player to track their progress and strive for better scores.

- **🎓 Educational Focus**: The primary goal of the game is to educate forest rangers and those interested in conservation about proper wildlife and plant monitoring techniques.

## 🚀 Installation and Execution

### 1. **Clone the Repository with the 'VIdeojuego' Branch**:
   ```bash
   git clone --branch VIdeojuego https://github.com/santiagosauma/Proyecto-AWAQ---MIDAS.git

2. **Open the Project in Unity**:
   - Open **Unity Hub**.
   - Click on `Add` and select the folder where you cloned the repository.
   - Open the project and wait for Unity to load all assets.
   - Ensure that you are using the correct version of Unity that is compatible with the project (this information is typically found in the `ProjectSettings`).

3. **Run the Game**:
   - Press the `Play` button in Unity to start the game.
   - The game will launch, beginning with the tutorial in the house. Follow the instructions to learn how to navigate and use the in-game tablet.

4. **Build and Deploy (Optional)**:
   - If you want to deploy the game to an iPad, go to `File > Build Settings` in Unity.
   - Select `iOS` as the platform and configure the necessary settings.
